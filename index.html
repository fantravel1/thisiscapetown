Tourist-frequented areas like the V&A Waterfront, Sea Point promenade, Camps Bay, and Constantia are generally safe with normal urban precautions. The CBD requires more awareness after dark. Certain areas have higher crime rates driven by systemic inequality, not inherent danger. Practical steps include not displaying expensive items, being aware of surroundings, using registered transport, and asking local advice.

Summer is warm and dry (25-35°C). Winter (June-August) brings rain, dramatic storms, and green landscapes (12-18°C). The city changes personality with seasons. Atlantic beaches have cold water year-round (8-14°C), while False Bay is warmer (16-22°C in summer). Understanding the wind is essential — it determines which side of the peninsula to visit on any given day."

A week lets you experience different neighborhoods, see how the city shifts with wind and light, eat beyond tourist restaurants, and feel the rhythms of daily life. Two weeks starts to reveal the city's layers — the histories behind the architecture, the language shifts between areas, and the complexity that makes Cape Town extraordinary. The honest answer: Cape Town unfolds the more time you give it. It is not a checklist city."

                <p>It depends entirely on what experience you want. <strong>Sea Point</strong> gives you Atlantic promenade life — dense, diverse, walkable, with the ocean always in view. <strong>Bo-Kaap</strong> puts you in the heart of Cape Malay heritage, with the call to prayer and colorful streets. <strong>Woodstock</strong> is the creative hub, raw and evolving. <strong>Muizenberg</strong> offers warmer water and surf culture. <strong>Gardens/Oranjezicht</strong> is leafy and central.

                <p>Cape Town's neighborhoods are dramatically different from each other. <strong>Sea Point/Green Point</strong> is high-density Atlantic coast living. <strong>The CBD</strong> is the commercial and governmental heart at the mountain's base. <strong>Bo-Kaap</strong> is a centuries-old Cape Malay community with its own architecture and food traditions. <strong>Woodstock/Salt River</strong> mixes creative studios with working-class communities navigating gentrification. <strong>Observatory</strong> is bohemian and student-driven. <strong>Constantia</strong> has wine estates and old money. <strong>Muizenberg/Kalk Bay</strong> is surf culture on the warmer False Bay side. <strong>Khayelitsha</strong> and <strong>Mitchells Plain</strong> are large township communities where much of the city's population lives.</p>

                <p>Safety in Cape Town is real and nuanced. Tourist-frequented areas — the V&amp;A Waterfront, Sea Point promenade, Camps Bay, Constantia, Kalk Bay — are generally safe with standard urban awareness. The CBD requires more attention after dark. Some areas have higher crime rates, driven by systemic inequality rather than inherent danger.</p>
                <p>Practical guidance: don't flash expensive devices, stay aware of your surroundings, use registered transport at night, and ask locals for current advice about specific areas. Millions of people live full, rich lives across every part of this city. Fear without context serves no one.</p>

                <p><strong>Sea Point</strong> is urban Atlantic coast life — morning runs on the promenade, coffee shops, diverse restaurant strips, the crash of cold ocean. It's walkable, safe feeling, and always busy. The vibe is cosmopolitan and well-serviced.</p>
                <p><strong>Woodstock</strong> is Cape Town's creative engine — galleries, street art, design studios, craft beer, and the Old Biscuit Mill Saturday market. But it's also a neighborhood navigating gentrification. The energy is raw, real, and evolving. More grit, more character.</p>
                <p><strong>Bo-Kaap</strong> is history you can touch — cobbled streets, colorful homes, mosques, and the smell of Cape Malay cooking. It's a living community, not a museum. Staying here means experiencing a cultural identity that has survived centuries of pressure.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                <p>Wind and weather don't just affect your visit — they define it. The <strong>Cape Doctor</strong> (southeast wind) blows hard in summer, especially December-February. It can shut down beach plans on one side of the peninsula while the other side is calm. Learning to read the wind is a genuine Cape Town survival skill.</p>
                <p><strong>Summer</strong> (Nov-Mar): Hot, dry, long days, intense UV. The wind is the main variable. <strong>Winter</strong> (Jun-Aug): Rainy, dramatic storms, green landscapes, fewer crowds. The city shows a completely different personality. <strong>Shoulder seasons</strong> (Apr-May, Sep-Oct): Often the best — mild, less wind, less crowded.</p>
                <p>The Atlantic ocean stays cold all year (8-14°C). False Bay warms up in summer (16-22°C). This temperature difference shapes where people go, what they do, and how the city feels.</p>

                <p>Cape Town's geography is its history made visible. The Group Areas Act during apartheid forcibly removed communities based on race — District Six was bulldozed, Bo-Kaap survived, and the townships of the Cape Flats were created through forced relocation. These are not abstract facts. They explain why the city looks the way it does today.</p>
                <p>Understanding this doesn't require guilt or spectacle. It requires respect. Know that when you walk through different areas, you are walking through layers of policy, resistance, survival, and rebuilding. The city is honest about its past when visitors are willing to listen.</p>

                <p>The key is approaching with curiosity and respect rather than a camera-first mentality. Ask locals what they do on weekends. Eat where they eat. Listen to the languages around you. Cape Town's culture is not performed — it's lived. The deeper you go, the more it reveals.</p>

                <p><strong>MyCiTi buses</strong> cover the main routes and are reliable. <strong>Uber/Bolt</strong> work well across the city. <strong>Minibus taxis</strong> are the transport backbone for most Capetonians — they follow fixed routes, are affordable, and give you a real sense of the city's movement patterns. <strong>Renting a car</strong> is useful for the peninsula and winelands.</p>
                <p>Walking is excellent in Sea Point, the CBD, and along the waterfront. Cycling is growing but still limited. The key to responsible movement is recognizing that your transport choices shape whose economy you participate in. Using local transport, shopping at local businesses, and engaging with the full geography of the city matters.</p>

                <p>Daily life in Cape Town varies as much as the geography.

In <strong>Woodstock</strong>, creative studios open alongside corner shops that have been there for decades.</p>
                <p>The mountain is always there — orientation, weather gauge, identity marker. People check the wind before making plans. Braai smoke rises on weekends everywhere. The diversity of daily routines is what makes Cape Town a mosaic, not a monolith.</p>

                <p>You can see the major landmarks in 3-4 days. But understanding Cape Town? That's a different question. A <strong>week</strong> lets you feel the rhythm — experience different neighborhoods, eat beyond tourist restaurants, notice how the wind changes the city's mood, and start to read the landscape for its history.</p>
                <p><strong>Two weeks</strong> reveals layers: language shifts between areas, the way architecture tells political stories, the food traditions behind the menus. The honest answer is that Cape Town unfolds the more time you give it. This is not a checklist city. The people who love it most are the ones who stopped rushing through it.</p>
