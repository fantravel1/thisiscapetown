Use MyCiTi buses for reliable main routes — they connect the airport, CBD, Sea Point, and Table View. Uber and Bolt work well citywide and are affordable by international standards. Consider using minibus taxis, which are the transport backbone for most Capetonians — they follow fixed routes, are very affordable, and give you a real sense of the city's movement patterns. Rent a car for peninsula drives and winelands day trips. Walk within walkable neighborhoods like Sea Point, the CBD, and along the waterfront. The key is engaging with the full geography and economy of the city, not just the tourist-facing parts."

The MyCiTi bus system is the most reliable option for visitors — it covers key routes including the airport to CBD, along the Atlantic coast to Sea Point, and out to Table View and Bloubergstrand. You need a myconnect card, which you can buy and load at MyCiTi stations. Minibus taxis are the most extensive public transport network, covering routes across the entire city and used daily by millions of Capetonians. The Metrorail train network exists but has faced significant challenges with reliability and safety — the Simon's Town line along False Bay is scenic but service is inconsistent. Cape Town is not a city with a single integrated metro system, so most residents combine multiple transport modes."

          <h2>A City That Does Not Fit in One Walk</h2>
          <p>
            Cape Town is not a walkable city in the way Amsterdam or Barcelona are. It is spread across a peninsula, draped over a mountain, and shaped by coastlines that stretch in every direction. The distances between neighborhoods are real distances — measured in kilometers, shaped by geography, and deepened by a history of spatial planning that deliberately separated communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means transport is not a convenience question. It is a structural one. How you move through Cape Town determines what you see, who you encounter, and whose economy you participate in. A visitor who only takes Ubers between tourist hotspots experiences a fundamentally different city than one who rides a MyCiTi bus to Sea Point or watches the minibus taxi system pulse through the city at rush hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of this requires guilt. It requires awareness. Cape Town has multiple transport options that work at different levels of comfort, cost, and connection to the city's daily life. This guide covers them honestly — what works, what does not, what is changing, and what your choices mean.
          </p>
          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Cape Town's transport infrastructure reflects its history. Apartheid-era planning pushed communities to the periphery and built the city around cars. The result is a city where most residents depend on minibus taxis, while visitors often never leave the Uber-and-rental-car bubble. Understanding this gap is the first step toward moving through the city with awareness.</p>

            <p class="feature-card__text">Cape Town's most reliable public transport for visitors. MyCiTi covers key routes: airport to CBD, along the Atlantic coast through Green Point and Sea Point, and out to Table View and Bloubergstrand. Buses run on dedicated lanes where available, with scheduled stops and electronic displays.</p>
            <p class="feature-card__text" style="margin-top: var(--space-xs);"><strong>How it works:</strong> Buy a myconnect card at any MyCiTi station (R35 for the card, then load credit). Tap on and tap off — fares are distance-based. Cards are reloadable at stations and selected retailers. The airport route is the most useful for arrivals.</p>

Affordable by international standards — a trip from the CBD to Sea Point runs R40-70, airport to city center R200-350 depending on traffic.

            <p class="feature-card__text">Useful for exploring the full peninsula — Cape Point, Chapman's Peak Drive, the winelands, and the False Bay coast. Major international and local rental companies operate from the airport and city center. Driving is on the left side of the road.</p>
            <p class="feature-card__text" style="margin-top: var(--space-xs);"><strong>What to know:</strong> Cape Town drivers are generally courteous but assertive. Parking in the CBD uses pay-and-display or informal car guards (a tip of R5-10 is customary). Petrol stations are full-service — an attendant fills your tank. Do not leave valuables visible in the car.</p>

            <p class="feature-card__text">Excellent within certain neighborhoods. The Sea Point promenade is one of the best urban walks in Africa. The CBD, Gardens, Green Point, and the V&amp;A Waterfront are all comfortable for walking. Bo-Kaap's cobbled streets reward exploration on foot.</p>
            <p class="feature-card__text" style="margin-top: var(--space-xs);"><strong>The limits:</strong> Cape Town is not a city where you can walk between neighborhoods easily. The distances are real — Sea Point to Muizenberg is 25km. Walking is excellent within clusters but impractical between them. Sidewalk infrastructure varies significantly by area.</p>

            <h3 class="feature-card__title">Cycling</h3>
            <p class="feature-card__text">Growing but still limited as daily transport. Dedicated cycling paths exist along parts of the Sea Point promenade, Green Point, and some CBD routes. The Cape Argus cycle tour is world-famous, and recreational cycling is popular on weekends.</p>
            <p class="feature-card__text" style="margin-top: var(--space-xs);"><strong>Reality check:</strong> Most roads lack dedicated cycling infrastructure. The wind can be brutal, especially in summer. For visitors, cycling works well as a recreational activity in specific areas rather than as a primary transport mode. Some rental shops in Sea Point and the Waterfront offer bikes.</p>

              <p>Cape Town International Airport is about 20km from the city center. Three main options, each with different trade-offs.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>MyCiTi bus (Route A01):</strong> The most affordable option. Runs from the airport to Civic Centre station in the CBD. Takes about 30-40 minutes depending on traffic. You need a myconnect card — buy one at the airport MyCiTi kiosk before boarding. Fare is roughly R80-100</li>
                <li><strong>Uber or Bolt:</strong> The most convenient option. R200-350 depending on time of day and traffic. Direct to your accommodation. Airport pickups are well-organized at both the domestic and international terminals</li>
                <li><strong>Car rental:</strong> All major companies are in the airport terminal. If you plan to explore the peninsula or winelands, picking up a car at arrival makes sense. Pre-book for better rates</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Walkable cluster 1:</strong> Sea Point, Green Point, V&amp;A Waterfront — continuous promenade and sidewalks, the city's most pedestrian-friendly strip</li>
                <li><strong>Walkable cluster 2:</strong> CBD, Gardens, Bo-Kaap — all within 10-15 minutes of each other on foot. Woodstock is a 20-minute walk from the CBD</li>
                <li><strong>Needs transport:</strong> Muizenberg (25km south), Constantia (15km, behind the mountain), Kalk Bay (30km along the coast), Hout Bay (20km via the mountain)</li>
                <li><strong>Best strategy:</strong> Base yourself in one cluster and use MyCiTi, Uber, or a car for cross-city trips. Do not try to walk between clusters</li>

                <li><strong>The reality:</strong> Metrorail has suffered from arson attacks, cable theft, infrastructure deterioration, and inconsistent scheduling. Service has been gradually rebuilding, but reliability varies week to week</li>
                <li><strong>Current advice:</strong> Check the latest status before planning around trains. When the Simon's Town line is running, it is genuinely worth the journey. But do not rely on it as your primary transport — have a backup plan</li>
                <li><strong>Context:</strong> The rail system's struggles are a national infrastructure challenge, not a Cape Town quirk. It matters because functional rail would transform how millions of residents commute</li>

                <li><strong>The minibus taxi system</strong> employs thousands of drivers and supports entire networks of communities. Using it — even once — means participating in the city's actual infrastructure, not just the visitor overlay</li>
                <li><strong>Geography matters:</strong> Apartheid spatial planning pushed communities far from economic centers. The distances people commute daily in Cape Town are a direct legacy of this. Understanding that the taxi ranks you pass are economic lifelines, not curiosities, changes how you see the city</li>

    <!-- ========== THE MINIBUS TAXI SYSTEM ========== -->

            <p class="split__label">Understanding the System</p>
            <h2 class="split__title">The Minibus Taxi System</h2>
            <p class="split__text">
              The minibus taxi is not a Cape Town curiosity. It is a South African institution. Born from apartheid-era necessity — when the state refused to provide adequate public transport for Black communities — the taxi industry built itself into the largest public transport network in the country. It moves an estimated 15 million people daily across South Africa, and in Cape Town, it is the way most of the city gets to work, school, shops, and home.
            </p>
            <p class="split__text">
              The system runs on fixed routes with recognized ranks (stations) and stops. Fares are set by route and are remarkably affordable. Drivers know their routes deeply. The Toyota Quantum 15-seater is the standard vehicle — so ubiquitous it has become a cultural icon. Taxis run from early morning until evening, with frequency determined by demand rather than a timetable. During rush hours, they move constantly.
            </p>
            <p class="split__text">
              For visitors, the minibus taxi can feel unfamiliar. There is no app. Routes are learned, not mapped. Hand signals indicate destinations. But this is not chaos — it is a self-organized system with its own deep logic, developed over decades by communities who built what the state would not provide. It deserves understanding and respect, not exoticization.

          <h3>Minibus Taxi Etiquette</h3>
          <p>
            If you decide to use a minibus taxi — and you should consider it — here is what to know.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding your taxi:</strong> Major ranks exist at the Cape Town Station, in the CBD, and in every neighborhood. Taxis also pick up along their routes at recognized stops. Ask a local or a security guard at a rank which taxi goes to your destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Signaling:</strong> Each route has a hand signal. Pointing a finger down means city center. Other gestures indicate different destinations. If unsure, simply tell the gaartjie (assistant) or driver where you are going.</li>
            <li><strong>Paying:</strong> Have cash ready — small notes and coins. Fares are fixed by route. If you are sitting near the front, other passengers may pass their money through you to the driver. Pass it along and pass change back. This chain of trust is part of the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Your stop:</strong> Tell the driver or knock on the roof or window when you are approaching your stop. The taxi will pull over. Move with awareness — these stops are quick.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect:</strong> This is people's daily commute, not a tourism experience. Be courteous, do not photograph people without permission, and treat the taxi like what it is — public transport that carries the city.</li>
          </ul>

                <p>Responsible movement in Cape Town starts with recognizing that your transport choices shape whose economy you participate in. <strong>MyCiTi buses</strong> are reliable and connect the airport, CBD, Sea Point, and Table View. <strong>Uber and Bolt</strong> work well across the city and are affordable by international standards. <strong>Minibus taxis</strong> are the transport backbone for most Capetonians — they follow fixed routes, are very affordable, and give you a real sense of the city's daily movement.</p>
                <p><strong>Rent a car</strong> for peninsula and winelands exploration. <strong>Walk</strong> within walkable neighborhoods like Sea Point, the CBD, and along the waterfront. The key is engaging with the full geography and economy of the city. Taking Ubers exclusively between tourist hotspots keeps your spending within a narrow slice. Using public transport, walking through neighborhoods, and buying from local shops distributes your economic presence more widely. The goal is not guilt — it is awareness of the systems you move through.</p>

                <p>Yes, but it works differently from European or Asian cities. Cape Town does not have a single integrated metro system. Instead, it has several overlapping networks.</p>
                <p>The <strong>MyCiTi bus system</strong> is the most reliable for visitors. It covers the airport to CBD route, the Atlantic coast (Sea Point, Green Point), and extends to Table View and Bloubergstrand. You need a myconnect card, available at MyCiTi stations. <strong>Minibus taxis</strong> are the most extensive network — they cover virtually every route in the city and are used by the majority of residents daily. The <strong>Metrorail train</strong> network exists but has faced serious challenges with reliability, safety, and infrastructure. The Simon's Town coastal line is scenic and gradually rebuilding service, but check the latest status before relying on it.</p>
                <p>Most Capetonians combine multiple transport modes in a single day. The city rewards the same flexibility from visitors.</p>

              <span>Are Uber and Bolt available in Cape Town?</span>

                <p>Yes, both are widely available and commonly used. <strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Bolt</strong> operate across Cape Town, including airport pickups. They are affordable by international standards — a ride from the CBD to Sea Point is roughly R40-70 (about $2-4 USD), and from the airport to the city center is R200-350 (about $11-19 USD) depending on traffic and time of day.</p>
                <p>Rides are tracked via the app, payment is cashless, and driver details are shared — making them a safe and convenient option, particularly at night. Wait times in the city center, Sea Point, and the Waterfront are usually under 5 minutes. Bolt tends to be slightly cheaper than Uber for identical routes. Both apps are reliable enough that many residents use them as a primary transport mode.</p>

                <p>Minibus taxis are the backbone of public transport in Cape Town and across South Africa. They are privately operated minibuses — typically <strong>Toyota Quantum 15-seaters</strong> — that follow fixed routes throughout the city. An estimated 60-70% of Cape Town's daily commuters rely on this system.</p>
                <p>Fares are very affordable, usually R10-25 depending on distance, paid in cash. Taxis run from early morning until evening, with frequency driven by demand rather than a timetable. To use them, stand at a recognized stop and signal the driver with a hand gesture indicating your destination. Pay the fare to the driver or pass cash forward through other passengers.</p>
                <p>The minibus taxi system was built by communities in response to apartheid-era neglect of public transport for Black South Africans. It is a uniquely South African institution — a self-organized network that moves millions of people every day. It is not exotic. It is not quaint. It is the actual transport infrastructure that carries the majority of the city, and it deserves respect and understanding on those terms.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                <p>An Uber or Bolt from Cape Town International Airport to the city center (CBD, Gardens area) costs roughly <strong>R200-350</strong> (about $11-19 USD), depending on the time of day, traffic conditions, and surge pricing. The trip takes 20-35 minutes depending on traffic.</p>
                <p>To <strong>Sea Point</strong>, expect R250-400. To the <strong>V&amp;A Waterfront</strong>, around R200-350. To <strong>Camps Bay</strong>, R300-450. These are estimates — always check the app for live pricing before requesting. Rush hour (7-9am, 4-7pm) and late Friday afternoons can push prices and travel times up significantly.</p>
                <p>The <strong>MyCiTi bus</strong> from the airport is a fraction of the cost at R80-100, if you are willing to buy a myconnect card at the airport kiosk and do not mind the slightly longer journey to the Civic Centre station.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
              <span>Can I rent a car in Cape Town and is it worth it?</span>
              <span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                <p>Renting a car is worth it if you plan to explore beyond the city center. The <strong>Cape Peninsula drive</strong> (Chapman's Peak, Cape Point, Simon's Town), the <strong>winelands</strong> (Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl), and the <strong>False Bay coast</strong> are all dramatically better with your own vehicle. If you are staying only in the city bowl and Atlantic seaboard, Uber and MyCiTi will handle most of your needs.</p>
                <p><strong>Practical notes:</strong> Driving is on the left. South Africa uses a mix of traffic lights (called robots locally) and traffic circles. Most roads are well-maintained. Petrol stations are full-service — an attendant fills your tank (tip R5-10). Parking in the CBD uses pay-and-display meters or informal car guards. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, even in "safe" areas. International visitors need their home country license plus an international driving permit if the license is not in English.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                <p>Walking safety in Cape Town depends heavily on where and when. <strong>Sea Point promenade</strong>, the <strong>V&amp;A Waterfront</strong>, <strong>Green Point</strong>, <strong>Camps Bay</strong>, <strong>Kalk Bay</strong>, and <strong>Constantia</strong> are all comfortable for daytime walking. The <strong>CBD and Gardens</strong> are fine during business hours but require more awareness after dark. <strong>Bo-Kaap</strong> is generally safe during the day.</p>
                <p>General walking principles: stay aware of your surroundings, do not walk with expensive devices displayed, stick to populated routes, and ask locals about any areas you are unsure about. Sidewalk infrastructure varies — some areas have excellent pedestrian paths while others have minimal or no sidewalks. At night, even in safe-feeling areas, Uber or Bolt is a reasonable choice for trips longer than a few blocks.</p>
