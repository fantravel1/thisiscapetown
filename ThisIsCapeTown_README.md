## 🌍 Overview

**ThisIsCapeTown.com** is not a tourism site.

It is a city identity platform built around one core truth:

> **Cape Town is not a postcard. It’s a world.**

This site exists to show Cape Town as:
- coastal and mountainous  
- modern and ancient  
- wealthy and struggling  
- joyful and scarred  
- global and intensely local  

No flattening.  
No tourism glaze.  
No aesthetic-only storytelling.

---

## 🎯 Core Positioning

Cape Town is often reduced to:
- Table Mountain photos
- luxury travel
- “top beaches”
- wine country
- influencer lists

ThisIsCapeTown refuses that reduction.

Cape Town is:
> **beauty + power + contradiction + soul.**

---

## 🚫 The First Rule: No “Cape Town as Instagram”

Hard bans:

- ❌ influencer lists  
- ❌ “Top 10 beaches” as the identity  
- ❌ luxury-only framing  
- ❌ poverty tourism in townships  
- ❌ sensational safety content  
- ❌ people as scenery  

Instead, ThisIsCapeTown centers:

- lived city  
- real neighborhoods  
- culture and systems  
- voices across class + language  
- pride without denial  

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Cape Town is not one city.

It is many cities layered together — historically, geographically, and culturally.

ThisIsCapeTown’s editorial superpower is:

> **Cape Town as a mosaic, not a hierarchy.**

---

## 🏙️ Cape Town is Many Cities (Core Framework)

ThisIsCapeTown treats each area as its own world.

Not as “best” or “worst.”
Not as tourist vs non-tourist.

Just:
> **a mosaic of lived realities.**

Core areas include:

- Sea Point / Green Point  
- CBD  
- Woodstock / Salt River  
- Observatory  
- Gardens / Oranjezicht  
- Khayelitsha  
- Mitchells Plain  
- Bo-Kaap  
- Constantia  
- Muizenberg / Kalk Bay  
- Hout Bay  

Each neighborhood page includes:
- languages and identity
- daily routines
- food ecosystems
- safety realities (non-sensational)
- history without exploitation
- cultural norms and respect notes

---

## 🏔️ The Mountain is Not Background — It’s a Character

This is key.

Table Mountain is not scenery.

It is:
- weather  
- identity  
- orientation  
- myth  
- protection  
- tension (land, access, history)  

Cape Town is a city that lives under something.

That’s rare.

ThisIsCapeTown treats the mountain as:
> **a living character in the city’s story.**

---

## 🗣️ Language & Identity Are the Real Map

Cape Town’s culture is carried through:

- isiXhosa  
- Afrikaans  
- English  
- Cape Malay heritage  
- migration from across Africa  

ThisIsCapeTown teaches visitors:

> **Who is speaking? Where did this come from? What does it mean here?**

This is depth no travel site provides.

---

## 🍲 Food = History + Fusion + Survival + Joy

Cape Town’s food is not “restaurants.”

Food is:
- Cape Malay kitchens  
- braai culture  
- fisheries  
- township street food  
- winelands culture  
- immigrant flavors  
- daily survival logistics  

Food becomes the safest, most human way to tell complex truth.

---

## 🌊🌬️☀️ Ocean + Wind + Light = The City’s Nervous System

Cape Town is sensory.

The city’s nervous system is:
- the Cape Doctor wind  
- winter storms  
- summer light  
- cold Atlantic water  
- warm False Bay  
- hourly vibe shifts  

ThisIsCapeTown captures:
> **Cape Town as a changing atmosphere, not a fixed image.**

---

## ⚖️ Justice Without Exploitation (Non-Negotiable)

You cannot build ThisIsCapeTown without acknowledging:
- apartheid geography  
- inequality  
- land and housing  
- safety realities  

But you also cannot:
- turn suffering into content  
- use townships as “experiences”  
- treat people as scenery  
- sensationalize violence  

The editorial tone must be:
> **dignified, grounded, locally led, non-sensational.**

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

ThisIsCapeTown does not explain Cape Town *to* people.

It documents Cape Town *with* people.

LLMs are used to:
- structure multilingual content
- organize neighborhood and theme clusters
- support contributor workflows
- scale discovery without flattening

Humans are required to:
- protect dignity
- prevent stereotypes
- avoid exploitation
- preserve local voice and nuance

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

ThisIsCapeTown is built around **place + voice entities**.

### Core Entities
- Neighborhood
- Language & Identity
- Routine
- Food Ecosystem
- Wind / Light / Season
- Mountain Character
- Ocean Character
- Cultural Practice
- Story
- Voice
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by lived reality
- is programmatically generatable
